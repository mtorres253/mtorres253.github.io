# Harnessing your Strengths and Staying Connected to your Values 

## Strengths
Beyond your coping skills, you have a set of traits totally unique to you that help you overcome challenges and allow you to thrive in the world. In times of stress it’s easy to lose sight of these strengths, but it’s important to remember that no matter what, even if you haven’t called upon them in a long time, they are an inherent part of who you are. Sometimes the simple act of reminding yourself of your strengths can pull you out of despair and reenergize you to begin moving forward again.

The more you’re aware of your strengths, the more you will be able to put them into practice.

<div class="story">
<p>I was meeting with a client for the first time a few years back. She had faced an enormous amount of adversity in her life, horrific violence, trauma, and she had lost most of the people close to her. She was feeling quite hopeless about the future and in particular a recent cancer diagnosis. I noted at some point in the conversation that I was struck with her resilience and how grounded she seemed in her spirituality. She paused for moment, appearing a bit surprised. She noted that no one had ever given her that feedback before. The whole tone of the conversation changed, she spoke with noticeably increased confidence in her voice. Even as she spoke of this incredibly challenging situation, she seemed to have a little flicker of hope that she would somehow get through it. Towards the end of our session, she asked, “What was that word you used to talk about me earlier?” I responded, “resilience?” and she smiled, sat up fully in her chair and said, “yes resilience, I really like that word! It feels good to think of myself that way.” We thought of ways for her to remind herself of her resilience and other strengths at least once a day. We met for a total of 5 times and each time she came in with a little more energy, a little more hopeful and started taking action not just around her new medical situation, but around other areas of her life. This is a great illustration of something I have observed over and over: connecting someone with the strengths they already have can be one of the most powerful tools you can give them.</p>

- “I am persistent and I kept checking in about that job I was interested in, even though they were always slow getting back to me, but eventually got an interview scheduled’

Now think of examples of times you have used at least 3 of the strengths you listed. Pick one of those memories think about it for a few moments and ask yourself &hellip;

- What happened?
- How did you feel when it happened?
- As you think about this event, notice your body. what are you feeling and where?  
- Be aware of any changes in your body, the way you feel emotionally, and/or any changes in your level of stress.  
- Did anyone notice reflect back that strength or accomplishment?
- If so, how did that feel?

## Personal Values
Values can be understood as the very best of how we see ourselves. Values are a critical part of how we make important changes in our lives. It is easy to become out of touch with our values and sometimes we hold on to values that no longer accurately reflect who we are, or maybe were never our values to begin with, but someone else’s values we took on. 

Values are often very personal in that they reflect how you were raised, your family, the culture you grew up in, the experiences you have had in your life, and often the very best of who you hope to become.  

It is also helpful to know that your strengths are very much a part of your past experiences and values.  

For example, if one of your strengths is that you are a fair person, you might have an underlying value for justice.  The strength of being fair can be a way to live that value in action. 

Take a few moments to reflect on what values are important to you and list them below (If you are having trouble thinking of any, take a look at the values list on the next page) As you do this try to withhold judgment and pick the values that resonate with you, as apposed to the ones you believe you should have. 

Now take a look at the list and rank them in order of importance to you. Write your top 3 values down 

Our strengths often reflect or are tied to the values we hold.
