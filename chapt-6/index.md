# Harnessing your Strengths

## Strengths
Beyond your coping skills, you have a set of traits totally unique to you that help you overcome challenges and allow you to thrive in the world. In times of stress it’s easy to lose sight of these strengths, but it’s important to remember that no matter what, even if you haven’t called upon them in a long time, they are an inherent part of who you are. Sometimes the simple act of reminding yourself of your strengths can pull you out of despair and reenergize you to begin moving forward again.

The more you’re aware of your strengths, the more you will be able to put them into practice.

<div class="story">
<p>I was meeting with a client for the first time a few years back. She had faced an enormous amount of adversity in her life, horrific violence, trauma, and she had lost most of the people close to her. She was feeling quite hopeless about the future and in particular a recent cancer diagnosis. I noted at some point in the conversation that I was struck with her resilience and how grounded she seemed in her spirituality. She paused for moment, appearing a bit surprised. She noted that no one had ever given her that feedback before. The whole tone of the conversation changed, she spoke with noticeably increased confidence in her voice. Even as she spoke of this incredibly challenging situation, she seemed to have a little flicker of hope that she would somehow get through it. Towards the end of our session, she asked, “What was that word you used to talk about me earlier?” I responded, “resilience?” and she smiled, sat up fully in her chair and said, “yes resilience, I really like that word! It feels good to think of myself that way.” We thought of ways for her to remind herself of her resilience and other strengths at least once a day. We met for a total of 5 times and each time she came in with a little more energy, a little more hopeful and started taking action not just around her new medical situation, but around other areas of her life. This is a great illustration of something I have observed over and over: connecting someone with the strengths they already have can be one of the most powerful tools you can give them.</p>
