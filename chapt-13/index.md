For these new skills to really work, it is important to continue to practice them.  They are similar to muscles, if you don’t exercise them, they aren’t likely to work very well. The key is to turn them into habits. It can be helpful to start with the one or two skills you found most helpful,  or the one that is most relevant to what is happening in your life at the moment.

Here are some tips for creating new habits and making them stick

1. Commit to Thirty Days - Three to four weeks is all the time you need to make a habit automatic. If you can make it through the initial conditioning phase, it becomes much easier to sustain. A month is a good block of time to commit to a change since it easily fits in your calendar.
2. Start Small - It is easy to get overly ambitious and take on too much. Start with just one of the skills at a time. Once one is a habit, you can add another. Big transformations start with small changes.
3. Try to do it every day - Consistency is critical if you want to make a habit stick. 
4. Set up Reminders - Around two weeks into your commitment it can be easy to forget. Just like how most people get really diligent about flossing for the first couple weeks after a dentist visit, but start to slowly drop off over time. Create reminders with your phone and computer, or even old fashioned post- its.  Whatever will work best for you.
5. Stay Consistent - The more consistently you practice your skills, the easier it will be to keep up. Practicing the same time of day, in the same place, or under the same circumstances, can make it easier for the practice to become a habit.
6. Enlist a friend – Tell someone about your goals who can help to keep you motivated if you feel like quitting.
7. Be Imperfect - Don’t expect your attempts to start and maintain a new habit to be easy. Be gentle with yourself.  Try your best, but expect a few bumps along the way.
8. Write it Down – Write your goals down. Writing makes your ideas clear, focuses you on your end result. And can make it feel more real.
9. Record your Success – Find a way to mark whenever you practice your new skills.  Then you can see your success visually over time!
10. Do it For Yourself - Choose the skills you enjoy practicing and feel are helpful to you. Don’t worry about the skills that you think you “should” be practicing.
